                <p>
                    Having over 2+ years of experience in backend development (Go/Python, gRPC/REST APIs) and frontend
                    engineering
                    (Angular/Tailwind CSS), I am seeking full-time roles in cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, or
                    distributed
                    systems. I am passionate about building scalable and secure solutions, from optimizing low-latency
                    APIs to
                    prototyping AI-driven threat intelligence. I have a proven ability to rapidly adapt to new
                    technologies in fast-paced
                    environments.
